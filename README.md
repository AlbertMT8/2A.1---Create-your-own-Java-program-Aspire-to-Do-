# ProductMaximizer Class in Java

The `ProductMaximizer` class in Java is a utility that identifies the two largest numbers in an array and calculates their product. This program is useful for finding the maximum product achievable by any two distinct elements in a given array of integers.

## Class Overview

### ProductMaximizer

This class contains a single method, `Maximizer`, which performs the following tasks:
- Iterates through an integer array to find the two largest distinct values.
- Prints the two largest values and their product.

#### Methods

- **Maximizer(int[] array)**
  - Accepts an array of integers.
  - Finds the largest and second largest distinct numbers in the array.
  - Prints the largest number, the second largest number, and their product.

## Code Example

The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `Maximizer` method with a sample array.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] numbers = {1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 9, 4};
    Maximizer(numbers);
}
